Title and Description

# Real-time-sensors

Motivation: things that I am interested in from hearing it from work/ reading about it. Also to practice certain skills/ forms of communication. The focus of this project is about high efficiency sensors that saves
time by having a data processing/cleaning inside the firmware before it sends it to a database or before it displays it on the device. The main challenge would be optimizing data optimizing script without going 
over the flash memory

Installation Instructions

Usage

# V1.0
Reads and writes humidity, temperature, gas and pressure from a BME688 onto local computer using an ESP32. Communication protocol used is I2C, wiring Diagram is included and drawn using Draw.io

# V2.0
Able to connect to Wifi, uploads to a SQL data (mysql, adafruit.io etc) passes through thingsboard first. -> other thought is to use RBPi as a database and upload data to RBPi. Need a way to upload data/save data if
wifi cuts out

# V3.0
Adds a data processing script here

# V4.0 Draw PCB board
